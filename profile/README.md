[I have potato blood in my veins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiqqC_fbP1c&ab_channel=Rydhorn)

My life, it's potato...\
In your working life, and your living\
it is always potatoes. I dream of potatoes.\
When we are going to harvest and in your\
mind and in your heart you feel that you are\
going to export the potatoes and you are not going to see it anymore.\
That hurts.


The family thinks always, from morning to evening
about the potatoes...
